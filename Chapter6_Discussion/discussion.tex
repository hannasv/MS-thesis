\chapter{Discussion - MOve content to ChX results and conclusion..}
\textit{This chapter summarizes the results presented in previous chapter and discusses their implications. It starts with a discussion about the model setup and the performance of the model for different parameters and setup. Afterwards, the input data are discussed before model performance is considered. Lastly, ... uncertainties in parameter choice/ dataset..? Is it possible to get a uncetaity from the ERA5 data and satellite data..?} 

\section{Dataset}
The downloaded size of \acrshort{ecc} is 17Gb, stored in \acrshort{netcdf}-files. 
In comparison to related works by \citeauthor{precip_nowcasting} (\citeyear{precip_nowcasting}) and \citeauthor{SunAirLSTM} (\citeyear{SunAirLSTM}), using datasets of size X and Y respectively.


\section{Numerical models}
\textbf{A reasonable accurate parameterization should provide a good estimate of the target variable, here cloud cover in isolation. Also on a higher level contribute to a improved model performance in the term of uncertainties attributed to a variable or process.}  

It is not impossible for models to perform equally well. Evaluate how well a model remake a phenomna. Hugo : det er medre optimsere for å treffe et spesilt fenomen of det er veldig viktig. 

%It is possible to achieve the same score with several  models. For this particular case it could be an idea to test the response of the model to particular weather phenomenas, that reflect a lot of sunight and would be necessary to hit to get a good over all performance. \textbf{Få et eksempel fra trude} 

It is important to know if the model is performing good for the right reasons.

Based on the small set of experiments run in this section, there is 
Datasets publish have different versions. Propose a suggestion for the content on \acrshort{ecc} v2.

To order to perform more complex experiments than shown in this section, more work need to be done behind the scene's to ensure better flow of data into memory. The combination of batch size and sequence length determine the load on memory per weight update date. The are inverse of each other, for short sequences the batch sizes can be larger. This is not the same as stating that this will be the optimal solution. Who knows the optimal solution might be outside the search space available on the used environment. Advances in hardware, algorithms and X drive advances in machine learning, as mentioned in Section \ref{ch:num_methods} \textbf{add more specific section}. The optimal solution may have always been out of reach. 

Unlike the \cite{}

A method for training deeper models on datasets is to reduce the spatial or temporal resolution. This is done in precipitation nowcasting, moving from 300x300 pixels to 100x100. Arguing that they want to remove noise.

    \item Skyer har en temporal opplæsning på en time så det er uaktelt å endre på denne for å trene modellen.

The statistical properties are slightly different for the different test sets.  

Short sequence length to reduce the computational complexity of experiments. 

No efforts have been made to assess the impact of the artefact on the performance.

One variable was not found to increase the performance.


data sets can be reduced without significant loss of information

A drawback of this study was not to account for correlations between radiomics features and the ROI, but such corrections were
not performed in this .
