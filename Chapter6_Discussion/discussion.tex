The statistical properties are slightly different for the different test sets.  

Short sequnece length to reduce the computational com-
plexity of experiments. 

No efforts have been made to assess the impact of the artefact on the performace.

One variable was not found to increase the performance.


data sets can be reduced without significant loss of information

A drawback of this study was not to account for correlations between radiomics features and the ROI, but such corrections were
not performed in this thesis.
