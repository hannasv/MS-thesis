\chapter{Dataset - European Cloud Cover }
%This chapter presents the developed methodology used in the compilation of the dataset. 
This section presents the developed algorithms necessary for the compilation of the dataset \acrfull{ecc}. It is pieced together from two sources, ERA5 reanalysis and \acrlong{msg} cloud mask.

Several candidate satellites were studied before arriving at the combination of datasets presented here. Spatiotemporal consistency and resolution was given high priority. The variable cloud mask is provided by many satellites, bringing valuable information in itself, but also for the retrieval of other variables restricted to cloud free conditions, such as humidity. The satellite product chosen for this project is the \acrfull{msg}. This satellite is in geostationary orbit, and has an exceptional temporal resolution, scans every 15min. Knowing that the average lifetime of a cloud is 60min or less, it seems like a reasonable choice (\cite{lohmann2016}, pp. 19). The finished dataset, described in detail below, is named \acrfull{ecc}.

\section{Domain}
For this project the geographical domain has been restricted to latitude, $\theta \in[30,50]$ and longitude $\phi \in [-15, 25]$. The resulting dimensions of the grid become $81\times161$ pixels. Figure \ref{fig:map} shows the domain included in this dataset. It covers central Europe and north Africa.

\section{Physical basis of variable decision} \label{sec:ecc}
The overall goal is to investigate whether basic meteorological variables such as temperature, pressure and humidity are sufficient for prediction of cloud fractional cover with a reasonable accuracy. As discussed in Section \ref{sec:cloud_in_climate_system}, cloud dynamics is far more complicated than what can be describes by these variables. 

This is a \textit{proof of concept study} aimed to demonstrate the feasibility of using \acrshort{ai} to parametize \acrshort{cfc}. Employing data driven learning to represent cloud physics and dynamics in its full complexity requires measurements from technologies not yet invented. If they did exist, the computational cost would be enormous, and even then there would be no guarantee that the model performance would be state-of-the-art.
%Not feasible in the foreseeable future to incorporate all the effects of micro-physics at a sufficient accuracy. 

Macrophysics properties describes the cloud as a whole. Examples of such properties are base height, top height, thickness, fractional cover and regime also known as type. Microphysical processes are all mechanisms involving the particles making up a cloud. Examples of these variable are cloud condensation nuclei and droplet number concentrations (\cite{Grabowski2019ModelingBetter}). Precipitation formation and cloud optical thickness is affected by changes on a microphysical level. However, they are undeniably closely related to the macrophysical properties of the cloud. Imagine precipitation without a cloud fractional cover? 

Focusing on the macro-physical aspect of clouds its is reasonable to chose large-scale variables, for which reliable estimates are available from using reanalyse or other climate models, thereby ensuring that it is possible to build usable application of this in the future. 

All variables are produced by ERA5. They are all surface variables or retrived from the pressure level closest to the surface. Some variables have been chosen because they are reliable, e.g. temperature and surface pressure. Others because they are essential in cloud formation, e.g. specific and relative humidity. This section will give a brief introduction to their role in cloud formation. 

From the weather maps on the news, low and high pressure systems might be familiar terms. Low pressure systems are often associated with precipitation, while high pressure systems are associated with nice weather. Due to its spherical geometry the earth is not equally heated. Warmer air rises, this generates a low pressure at the surface. As the air rises the temperature decreases. From on Equation \eqref{eq:clausius_clapeyron} it can be shown that, colder air can retain less vapour, enhancing the rate at which saturation is achieved. Under supersaturated conditions some of this vapour condenses, generating cloud water, forming a cloud, and occasionally precipitation. Summer is often associated with these convective motions generating cumulus type clouds. In presence of water at the surface, evaporation rates are also higher in a warmer climate. 

In areas of lower pressure the surrounding air will flow toward the low pressure centre to offset the pressure difference. Induced by Earths rotation the Coriolis effect force winds of low pressure system swirl counterclockwise north of the equator and clockwise south of the equator, causing an accumulation of air in the centre of low pressure system. Pushing it to higher altitudes in the atmosphere. A high pressure system exhibit the exact opposite behaviour, its swirls in the reverse direction, and the air flows from the centre. Diverging air masses cause sinking motions of parcels from higher in the atmosphere fill the space.
% air from higher in the atmosphere to sink and fill the space left.
% \textit{Air from higher in the atmosphere sinks down to fill the space left as air moves outward.} 
Winds transports the substances suspended in air, such as pollutants and humidity.

The dataset includes both relative and specific humidity. Relative humidity is a measure of how much vapour the air contains, relative to much it can hold at that temperature. It is unitless and ranges from 0 to 1. Conditions where relative humidity exceeds one are called supersaturated. Specific humidity is the ratio between mass of vapour and mass of air, with unit of $kg kg^{-1}$ (\cite{lohmann2016}, pp. 53-54). Whether the relative or specific humidity is the better predictor is not clear a priori. The data is gathered from the model level closest to the surface, at an altitude of 1000hPa (\cite{lohmann2016}, pp. 81-84). 

\section{Regridding scheme} \label{sec:remapping}
\input{Chapter4_Dataset/figurs/spherical_coord}
Computing cloud fractions based on cloud mask requires a regridding scheme. Common schemes for solving similar tasks are mean, nearest neighbour or area weighting. For this particular task, since the pixels are of uneven size, the area weighted seemed most appropriate. This section will provided a step-by-step description of the necessary preprocessing done for the compilation of \acrshort{ecc}, transforming clouds masks provided in \textit{space-view} to cloud fractions on a uniform grid. \acrshort{eumetsat} doesn't provide suitable software to tackle this particular task (personal communication EUMETSAT staff). Building the dataset requires the implementations of this software.

Implementing this algorithm is twofold, first detection algorithms determining the contributing pixel to the particular cells in the other coordinate system and their classification into the different categories such as \textit{corner}, \textit{centre}, \textit{left}, \textit{right}, \textit{upper and lower boundary}.
Secondly,  deriving the equation necessary for computing the area weighting and implementing them for each category. 

%The satellite retrievals are provided in a \textit{space-view} grid. 
Pixel-areas are computed using spherical coordinates. Figure \ref{fig:spherical_coords} shows a square projected on to a sphere. Deriving the equation for computing the area of an square in spherical coordinates, requires integrating over changes in latitude, $d\theta$ and longitude, $d\phi$. 

The general expression for the area of a square in spherical coordinates, is given by the following integral. 
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sphere_integral}
    A = -R^2\int_{ \theta - \delta \theta }^{\theta + \delta \theta} \int_{ \phi - \delta \phi }^{\phi + \delta \phi} cos\left( \theta' \right) d\phi' d\theta'
\end{equation}
%This can be rewriting into, \textbf{needs indices $(i, j)$ ..?}
rewriting the equation into
\begin{equation} \label{eq:sphere_finish}
    A \left( \theta, \phi, \delta \theta, \delta \phi   \right)= 2R^2 \left( sin\left( \theta + \delta \theta  \right) - sin\left(  \theta - \delta \theta  \right) \right) \delta \phi
\end{equation}
here $R=6378km$ denotes the distance to earth centre, $\theta$ the latitude and $\phi$ the longitude. Relating Equations \eqref{eq:sphere_integral} and \eqref{eq:sphere_finish} to Figure \ref{fig:spherical_coords} by setting $d \theta = 2 \delta \theta$ and $d \phi = 2 \delta \phi$.

% Estimating the extent of the cell.
The coordinate information is provided in grids of latitudes, $\theta$ (degrees north) and longitudes, $\phi$ (degrees east) values. These represent the centre of a pixel. To acquire the information about the extent of cells in a non-uniform grid require some simplifications. 

The changes in longitude (latitude) at a certain pixel are estimated by the average distance to neighbouring pixels in the relevant directions. Approximation of $d\phi$ and $d\theta$ have been done based on the two-dimensional fields of latitude and longitude values according to the below equations.% \eqref{eq:app_lon} and  \eqref{eq:app_lat}. 
%The horizontal extent of a pixel $(i,j)$ be determined by the the averaged distance between the longitude of neighbouring pixels. 
%, see Equation \eqref{eq:app_lon}. The same principles applies in the latitudinal direction, this version is shown in Equation \ref{eq:app_lat}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:app_lon}
    \delta \phi_{i,j} = \left| \frac{\phi_{i+1,j} - \phi_{i-1, j}}{4} \right|
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:app_lat}
    \delta \theta_{i,j} = \left| \frac{\theta_{i,j+1} - \theta_{i, j-1}}{4} \right|
\end{equation}

\input{Chapter4_Dataset/figurs/estimating_changes_in_longitude}
The cloud mask pixels are smallest at the nadir point, decreasing in all directions.
Figure \ref{fig:estimate_dlon} shows an example of three neighbouring pixels where the apparent pixel size increases going eastward. This results in different distances from the centre to the right and left neighbour, to take advantage of the analytical expression derived in Equation \ref{fig:correct_area}, the extent is approximated by taking the average of the right and left distances. From Figure \ref{fig:estimate_dlon} it becomes evident that the squares resembles trapezium. As far as the author know, it doesn't exist a solution to a area of a trapezium in spherical coordinates, and its not clear if approximating this using using another numerical method. Figure \ref{fig:pixels_contributing_to_cell} providing a visual inspection of the extents of the contributing pixels, it appears to be a reasonable simplification at the latitudes and longitudes of interest. 
%Since changes in degrees varies linearly this should not affect the extent of the cell. More than the error already present in the data. Det forklarer bare hvorfor buelengde ikke er nødvendig.

%\textbf{Present this as something that would be a minor correction.}
%A minor improvement, would be to derive the areas of trapezium in spherical coordinate, however this requires additional dependencies of 
%Failed to derive equations for trapezoidal shapes in spherical coordinate, therefore it never made sense to keep a different left, right, up and down extent. 

% Detecting which pixels that contribute to a cell.
Computing the area weighted average of cloud masks requires detecting the grid$_{\text{MGS}}$ contributing to the grid$_{\text{ERA5}}$ cell, and computing their area. The pixels are divided into five categories; \textit{centre}, \textit{left}, \textit{right}, \textit{up} and \textit{down boundary}. This categorisation is illustrated using different colours in Figure \ref{fig:pixels_contributing_to_cell}.

Let the subscripts denote the dataset pertaining to a particular grid. Grid$_{\text{MSG}}$ refers to the space-view grid of the \acrlong{msg} and grid$_{\text{ECC}}$ refers to the uniform grid originating from ERA5. It is worth noting that the grid$_{\text{ECC}}$ is identical to grid$_{\text{ERA5}}$.
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{python_figs/example_remapping_lat45_lon25.pdf}
    \caption{Remapping one cell, studying the number of pixels contributing to a cell. The pixels from satellite is classified into corner (grey), centre (pink), right (purple), left (yellow), down (green) and up (blue) }
    \label{fig:pixels_contributing_to_cell}
\end{figure}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:tot_area}
    A = \sum_{i=0}^{N} a_i
\end{equation}
\begin{equation} \label{eq:area_weighting}
    CF_{ECC} = \frac{1}{A} \sum_{i=0}^{N} a_i m_i
\end{equation}

Inserting $m_i = 1$ into Equation \eqref{eq:area_weighting} results in a $CF_{ECC}=1$, independently of the values of $a_i$, proving that the minor overlap between pixels in Figure \ref{fig:pixels_contributing_to_cell} doesn't affect the rage of cloud fraction, which remains in the range [0, 1]. The corner pixels are omitted, since in some cases more than four pixels was classified as corners. This has most likely have caused the circular pattern shown in Figure \ref{fig:area_pixel_signal}. This figure also show that the areas decrease in all direction away from the nadir point at $(0,0)$.

\end{figure} 

\section{Tests}
%The cloud masks are provided from EUMETSAT in multiple formats. The \acrshort{grib}-format takes up less disk space. However this format doesn't provide coordinates for grid types such as space view. This information is available in \acrshort{netcdf}-format and is made available for the reader via the supplementary folder. All satellite images are provided using the same grid (personal correspondence with EUMETSAT staff). 
A cause of errors in the development process is the different formats provide non consistent rotations of the data. Recap the raw satellite images in \textit{grib} is provided  direction of the scan, while the \acrshort{netcdf} format is postprosessed. They are mirrored images, shown in Figure \ref{fig:netcdf_vs_grib}. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{}
    \caption{Show the two file formats as mirrored images.}
    \label{fig:netcdf_vs_grib}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:visual_inspection_regridding} show the regridding of the raw data, clouds are illustrated in white, land mask in teal and ocean in purple. The original data is provided in four categories, land, ocean, cloud and off-earth disk. By regridded the raw data it quickly becomes apparent whether the indices correspoding to the domain has been used. 

CDO provide functionality to compute the area of a pixel in a uniform grid. To verify the implementations of Equation \ref{eq:sphere_finish} the results from both routines was compared by comuting the area of the ERA5 grid. The results was identical. It is worth noting that the implementation is scaled by $R$ to be consistent with CDO code used in this test. Multiplying by a large number and then dividing by the same number in the next step, does not make any other changes than the possibility of introducing additional numerical errors.

\end{figure}

\section{Missing Data} \label{sec:missing_values}
Missing values is inevitable when working with observational data. Sensors fail to collect measurements and data is missing. This can be either individual pixels or entire disks. In this project single NaN pixels are no pressing issue since they are remapped to fractions by using the area weighted mean. 
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale = 1.0]{python_figs/heatmap_missing_values.pdf}
    \caption[Heatmap showing missing hours for all months or years.]{Heatmap displaying missing hours separated in month and years.}

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}

    \includegraphics[scale = 1.0]{python_figs/heatmap_missing_values_monthly_sum.pdf}
    \caption{Barplot showing the monthly sum of missing values. This excludes the contribution from the periode of 2004 before the satellite was operational.}
    \label{fig:barplot_missing_values}
\end{figure}

In some cases the sensor fail to scan and in other cases the data has been destroyed prior to archiving. The result is the same, the data can never be recovered. Further down the chain of supply this can cause issues for the process of downloading, requested data has entered infinity loop without being detected by EUMETSAT. In combination with the maximum limit of pending request restricted to 20, the processed is slowed down. One request can contain ca. 3.5 months of hourly data. Since entire disks are missing, not single pixels,the closest time step available within the previous and trailing 45 minutes are chosen, when available. 

A summary of missing values per month in the data set is provided in Figure \ref{fig:heatmap_missing_values}. Aggregation of this missing values to month as provided in Figure \ref{fig:barplot_missing_values}. This is ment to illustrate any seasonal biases. This does not include the months of 2004 prior to the operalisation of the satellite.

As mentioned in Section \ref{sec:meteosat}, METeosat provide a two satellite system, occasionally both standby and the operational scan at the same time. To reduce the perturbations due to parallax (see Section X) of cloud, given a choice the operational satellite is chosen. In cases over technical failures, the standby scan is used, the scans are done from a different nominal position. However, the coordinate systems remain the same, since the standby scan is rectified to the position of the operational satellite before the product is realised (personal communication EUMETSAT staff). Comparing simultaneous measurements for the operational and the standby METeosat satellites, it becomes clear that they are unidentical. However, there has been no effort in quatifing the magnitude of the parallax, and correcting for it. 

Manually generated datasets are prone to human error, especially since the user need to download individual time steps to fill the gaps. The missing values was double checked, but there is no guarantee that a few additional time steps is available. To summarise the workflow, the author downloaded the data, detect missing times and manually choose the closest time step available within the previous and trailing 45 minutes. In retrospect the, the downloading options should be a factor when choosing data, this could potentially save a lot of time and frustration.

\section{Masks} \label{sec:mask}
The land sea masks are regridded from the HTAP-masks provided by \acrfull{metno}. In its original format the HTAP masks have a $0.1^o$ resolution and global coverage, not including the polar regions. These are regridded to a suitable resolution of $0.25^o$ using functionality available in PyAEROCOM \cite{pyaerocom}. %(\href{https://pyaerocom.met.no/}{https://pyaerocom.met.no/}). 
This is a python toolbox developed within the \acrfull{aerocom} project.
To avoid storing redundant data, only domain specific data is made available in the project supplementary repository. For more details see Section \ref{sec:s}
%To keep memory-requirements to a minimum only the parts of the filters relevant domain is stored in the supplementary material for this project.

\end{figure}
\begin{figure}
    \centering
    \includegraphics{python_figs/filters.pdf}
    \caption{Figure shows all filters, in white, available in the python package ``sciclouds''.}
    \label{fig:filters_subplot}
\end{figure}
Filters available \textit{land}, \textit{sea}, \textit{coastline} and \textit{artefact}. The coastline is defined to be all pixels that are not 100\% either land or sea. For land pixels, coastline pixels exceeding a 50\% threshold are included, the other pixels are regarded at the sea, argue that this is acceptable since this pixels at a level of at least 50\% most like sufficiently affected by maritime conditions that it is reasonable to classify them as sea pixels.

Based on a visual comparison to Figure \ref{fig:example_artefact}, the the artefact is defined to be all coastline pixels obeying the Inequality \eqref{eq:artefact_condition}.
\begin{equation} \label{eq:artefact_condition}
    \theta + \frac{1}{3}\phi < 40
\end{equation}
Figure \ref{fig:filters_subplot} show a subplot of all filters, including the artefact detecting filter. 
The number of occurrences of this artefact seem to follow a normal distribution see Figure \ref{fig:signal_artefact}. Keep in min that there has been no attempts to distinguish this signal from when the entire region is cloudy. This could for instance be done by studying the histograms from the ratio the artefact signal and land or no filter? The average cloud cover in the period is? 
% Different approaches for detecting the artefact, separating the land, sea and coastline pixels. Filters to remove artefact in future. Can also use this compute statistics over land and ocean. Add land sea mask as subplot. 
No efforts have been made to remove the artefact from the data. It is a thesis in itself %to remove the artefact
without introducing other complications like gaps in the dataset and or removing parts of an actual cloud.

\section{Climatological Statistics}
Write introduction. A lot of similar figure are generated and can be found in the Appendix. To avoid to much repetition statistical properties are used as a collective term for the following properties, mean, minimum, maximum, median, standard deviation and mean absolute error.

\subsection{Spatial statistics}

%%% BAR PLOT GLOBAL STATISTICS
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{python_figs/bar_plot_global_statistics_new_legend.pdf}
    \caption{Bar plot showing global statistics for different filters.}
    \label{fig:bar_plot_global_stats}
\end{figure}
To study the statistical properties at different parts of the domain the filters shown in Figure \ref{fig:filters_subplot} was applied to the data before computing the statistical properties. Figure \ref{fig:bar_plot_global_stats} shows a barplot summarising the statistical properties for the five variables and four filters including the entire region. Shows minor differences between the statistical filters. The largest difference can be seen in the maximum value of relative humidity, having a lot larger max over land than ocean. The relative difference in magnitude between MAD and STD and the other variables from the reanalysis dataset, is quite large. This can most likely be explained since its assimilated model data, and has therefore been smoothed.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%% MONTHLY MEANS
Figure \ref{fig:monthly_mean_ts_vars} shows the spatially averaged monthly mean values for all values. Seasonal effects and differences between land and ocean is evident among all variables. For temperature and relative humidity one can see a more pronounced seasonal cycle over land the ocean. For the remaining variables they appear to be a small shift toward higher values. 
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{python_figs/monthly_means.pdf}
    \caption{Spatially averaged monthly values. Filters are applied for land and sea.\textbf{Im looking into why no filter is below both land and ocean and not in the middle}}
    \label{fig:monthly_mean_ts_vars}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:random_week} shows the spatially averaged time series for the first week of August in 2012. Attempting to illustrate the relative strength of the signal feed to the input sequence. As a reference, the signal over land and ocean is provided. All variables display diurnal variations. Surface pressure provide nearly constant values and doesn't appear to be a good predictor. If a model predicting the same value as the dasy before, it doesn't provide more information.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{python_figs/spatially_averaged_one_week_from_2012-08-01.png}
    \caption{Spatially averaged time series, the filters are applied for land and sea.}
    \label{fig:random_week}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Temporal statistics}
Figure \ref{fig:all_stats_tcc} shows the temporal statistics for the cloud cover in ECC. Similar figures for the remaining variables in the dataset is presented in Section \ref{sec:all_stats} in the Appendix.  The topography is a clear factor, comparing Figure \ref{fig:all_stats_tcc} to Figure \ref{fig:map} the spatial patterns are very similar. 
%% CLOUD FRACTIONAL COVER
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{python_figs/all_stat_variable_tcc.pdf}
    \caption{Contour plot showing the local (pixel) statistics for cloud fractional cover.}
    \label{fig:all_stats_tcc}
\end{figure}

The mean values show that on average the coastline have a lower cloud cover than the adjacent areas. This is supported by the bar plot (see Figure \ref{fig:bar_plot_global_stats}). From the minimum values of cloud cover it becomes evident that there is a  artefact present in the dataset. This is most likely caused by the remapping routine. Figure \ref{fig:area_pixel_signal} shows the patterns of magnitude of the areas contributing to a pixel. One would might expect this to be zero over the entire domain, when it not it means that these pixel have clouds at every hour in the last 14 years. The max value is as expected, one over the entire region, this tells you that at some point every pixel is cloudy. The standard deviation is higher over land, this is caused by larger variation in cloud cover in these regions. The median and mad show similar patterns, here lowest values along the coast.

\subsubsection{Correlation - target vs. predictors}
%%% CORRELATION
Correlation describe how strong a pair of variables are linearly related. A positive correlation tells you that a increase in one variable results in a increase in the other. A negative correlation describes the opposite connection, implying that a increase in one variable cause a decrease in the other.
\begin{figure}[ht]
    \centering
    \includegraphics{python_figs/correlation_figure.pdf}
    \caption{Contour plot showing the correlation between environmental variables and cloud fractional cover. }
    \label{fig:correlation_tcc_vs_envio}
\end{figure}
Figure \ref{fig:correlation_tcc_vs_envio} show the linear correlation coefficient from pairs of cloud cover and environmental variables such as temperature, pressure, relative and specific humidity. Recall that all enviornmental variables is produced by reanlysis. Pink illustrates negative correlation while green illustrates a positive correlation. Different patterns emerge from all variables. %, implying that they could be useful as predictors. 

Over land relative humidity is dominated by positive correlation to cloud cover, some part of Africa and the ocean in eastern Mediterranean has a negative correlation. The image the surface pressure is remarkable similar, they share a pattern, but have opposite signs. The negative sign seems reasonable, since high pressure is often caused by sinking motions in the atmosphere and clouds are formed by rising motions. 

Specific humidity show a clear shift at longitudinal degree 10. The land area in the west are negativelly correlated while the eastern part are positively correlated. 

In most locations temperature is negatively correlated with cloud cover except in parts of the Alps, north coast of France and in north Africa. This seems reasonable since warmer air can retain more vapours, on the other hand this could enhance evaporation rate, making more vapour available for condensing onto particles.

\section{Summary}
\acrshort{ecc} comprises of five variables collected from two sources; ERA5 and EUMETSAT. The resolution available in ERA5 was preserved, while remapping the cloud mask to cloud fractions. The final product consist of the variables temperature, pressure, cloud fraction, specific humidity and relative humidity, available hourly data on a $0.25^o$ uniform grid resolution in the period from April 2004 to December 2018. Cloud fractional cover (\acrshort{cfc}) is produced from area weighting cloud masks. These computations are described in \ref{sec:remapping}. The remaining variables are on their original format as provided by \acrfull{ecmwf}. A summary of the original sources of the dataset is given in Table \ref{tab:dataset_summary}. More details on ERA5 is available in Section \ref{sec:era5} and on Section \ref{sec:EUMETSAT_cloud_mask} for more information about cloud mask. 
\input{Chapter2_Theory/tables/table_transposed.tex}
%Fractional cloud cover is computed from the cloud mask product retrieved by the second generations METeosat satellites. You can read more about this data in section \ref{sec:meteosat}. For simplicity we will refer to this dataset as European Cloud Cover Dataset, ECC from now on. The visual comparison between raw satellite images and cloud amount seem to agree. The cloud fractional distribution also retain the same shape as ERA5 and MODIS 6.1 Terra in the period from 2004 to 2018. \textbf{kilde?}
