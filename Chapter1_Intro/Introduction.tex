\chapter{Introduction} \label{ch:introduction}
Weather and climate have a major influence of life on earth. While the globe struggles to support the needs of a increasing population, human activity continuous to change the environment. Global warming is now a fact and the temperature keeps rising until it has reached the equilibrium climate temperature, also known as the \acrfull{ecs}. Emissions of greenhouse gases have a delayed influence on temperature. Providing a realistic estimate of future climates is important for motivating mitigation and hopefully limiting the temperature increase. This introduces the need for studying potential futures using a combination of \acrfull{esm} and different socioeconomic pathways. Based on idealised experiments, \acrfull{cmip5}, a ensemble of models used in the latest assessment report, results in \acrshort{ecs} in the range $2.1^oC$ to $4.7^oC$ (\cite{IPCC_CH9_climate_models}). Despite decades of research efforts this uncertainty has stayed constants since, \cite{hansen} first estimate of \acrshort{ecs} ranging $2.0^oC$ to $5.0^oC$ was published in the eighties. The socio-economic consequences related to the uncertainty is enormous (\cite{bony2015}). 
% Despite decades of research efforts this uncertainty has been reduced from \textbf{mistenkter at perioden klimasensitiviten representerer er helt forskjellig.} % The first estimates of \acrshort{ecs} made by \cite{hansen} where in the range []. This is not major improvement based on the decades of research provided in this period. 



%\section{Scope of this study}
%Including the effects of clouds on large scale processes, in climate models, has proven difficult \textit{There is very high confidence that uncertainties in cloud processes explain much of the spread in modelled climate sensitivity.  } (\cite{IPCC_CH9_climate_models}). 

%This thesis examines the potential for data driven methods to model cloud behaviour.

%Using idealised experiments they give model spread in \acrfull{ecs}. This describes the \textit{equilibrium change in global and annual mean surface temperature after doubling the $CO_2$ conditions from pre-industrial times.} For \acrshort{cmip5} the \acrshort{ecs} is $2.1^oC$ to $4.7^oC$. The is very high confidence that clouds are the primary factor attributing to the wide range. 

%This is a minor improvement from  \textbf{explain idealised experiments.} Hansen et. al. ran their experiments using a coarse resolution of $8^o \times 10^o$ grid box (lat $\times$ lon) and a doubling of the $CO_2$ concentrations from 315ppm to 630ppm. 

\section{Why data driven learning} \label{sec:intro_deep_learning}
%The methods considered is traditional statistical models (Autoregressive models) and newer deep learning \textit{algorithms} (Convolutional LSTM). Recurrent networks have proven valuable in fields such as speech recognition and image captioning, but will the beat the more used, auto regressive models. 
After decades of being mainly a research area of limited use, today artificial intelligence in the form of deep learning has become a part of our daily life. Face recognition technology has the ability to unlock your phone. Speech recognition allows you to dictate text messages. Self-driving buses are used in metropolitan areas around the world, including Oslo city centre. By manipulating images, you can make Monet paintings from pictures and transforming zebras to horses or the other way around (\cite{zhu2017_cycleGAN_monet_zebra}). Video manipulation can make appear to say and do things they never did. 

Deep learning has already proven its value in many fields. The scope of thesis is to implement and compare different methods for data driven learning to find the most suitable method for cloud predictions. For this task autoregressive models and \acrfull{convlstm} are considered. 
%\textit{This thesis attempts to answer if its a appropriate method for solving cloud predictions.} \textit{It remains a open question if its the best model for tackling this task, predicting cloud cover.} %Even thought machine leaning is has proven able for great advances in certain fields. 
Occam's razor is an old philosophical concept. It states that if two hypotheses are equally likely, the simplest one should be preferred. \textbf{kilde (ikke wikipedia)}. For this application, the compilation of a new dataset was deemed necessary. Named \acrfull{ecc}, and composed of reanalysis data from ERA5 and satellite retrievals from \acrfull{msg}. The dataset has a temporal resolution of one hour and spatial resolution of $0.25^o$. Clouds have a average lifetime of one hour (\cite{lohmann2016}). Based on this, it is conceivable that one can extract suitable features to make reasonable predictions. Focusing on a small part of the processes, stands the best chance of reducing the spread, which is why we chose to parameterize \acrfull{cfc} based on environmental variables.

There is currently a huge interest in and activities around machine learning and artificial intelligence.
The practical applications to climate research are under investigation. The last few years researchers have been attempting to incorporate machine learning into geosciences. Attempting to solve a wide range of problems, from rainfall runoff modelling (\cite{hess-23-5089-2019}) to  high-resolution weather forecasting (\cite{Rodrigues2018DeepDownscale:Forecast}).
% and air quality forecasting (sun and liu). %, precipitaiton nowcasting (Shi et al) and \textbf{kanskje: LES} \textit{deep neural network based feature representation for weather data.} \textbf{lui et al }. %Some attempts was more successful than others. 
Another more comprehensive machine learning project is lead by Tapio Schneider at Caltech. Along with his team of technologist they have ambitions to create a earth system model using machine learning. He and his team of researchers from MIT and former employees of Microsoft and Google hope to create a platform that can resolve clouds and hopefully reduce the uncertainty in climate sensitivity  (\cite{Voosen2018ScienceIntelligence}).

There is a high confidence that a lot if the spread is attributed to cloud feedback's (\cite{IPCC_CH9_climate_models}). Developing new methods for cloud cover predictions is believed to produce more reliable estimates of future climates.

%\textit{The data driven approach hold the potential to extract the correct information, across scales, necessary for predicting cloud cover at a satisfactory precision. Developing methods that eventually can contribute to reducing the spread in climate sensitivity. Producing a more accurate estimate of global mean temperature increase.} \textbf{skriv om}
