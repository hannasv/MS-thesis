This thesis is a joint work between \acrfull{uio}, \acrfull{simulamet} and \acrfull{oslomet}. First and foremost I would like to thank my supervisors Hugo L. Hammer (\acrshort{oslomet}), Trude Storelvmo (\acrshort{uio}) and Michael Riegler (\acrshort{simulamet}) for giving so much freedom to make my own choices regarding the data.

Thanks to Hugo and Michael for suggesting this interesting topic of \textit{Applying artificial intelligence to perform climate predictions}, and to Trude for joining us, allowing me to shift the focus toward applications to cloudphysics.
