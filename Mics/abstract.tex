%\subsection*{Introduce a challenge or unresolved issue that you will try and solve.} 
%Over the last decades researchers have been working on determining the climate sensitivity. 
There are large uncertainties in estimates of climate sensitivity for climate projections. These are related to cloud feedbacks and to how clouds are resolved in climate models. This inspire new parameterizations of cloud cover. It is unclear which level of sophistication is needed for these subgrid-scale parameterizations in order to model their effect on climate.

To investigate this problem from a new angle, namely the potential for data driven learning for parameterization of clouds, a new dataset, \acrfull{ecc}, was generated, using the self-implemented \acrfull{awrs}. The dataset is a combination of reanalysis and satellite data, and it covers the period from 2004 to 2018. % \textbf{for/in this study}. \textbf{enda tydligere på at jeg har gjort dette}.

Statistical methods, \acrfull{ar}- and \acrfull{convlstm}-models were trained and compared existing parameterizations in \acrshort{era5}, on their ability to parameterize cloud cover.

%$AR-B-L5$-model, had a \acrshort{mae} of $0.04901$, \acrshort{era5} of $0.20386$ and $ConvLSTM-B_{10}-SL_{24}-32-3\times3-32-3 \times3$ got $0.33621$.

%The state-of-the-art parameterization in \acrshort{era5} outperform both models.  
Unfortunately, the $AR-B-L5$-model is unable to produce a realistic 24-hour forecast, as it suffers from ``self-plagarims''. Every prediction it generates is a small reduction of the cloud cover at the previous timestep.

$ConvLSTM-B_{10}-SL_{24}-32-3\times3-32-3 \times3$, on the other hand, showed potential. A few hours into the forecast it is able to reproduce some of the features seen in \acrshort{ecc}. Nevertheless, the model experienced some issues with blurred lines. $ConvLSTM-B_{10}-SL_{24}-32-1\times1-32-1 \times1$ showed a lower skill on reproducing the test period from 2014 to 2018, but a superior ability to produce a 24-hour forecast. 

None of the models in this study were able to compete with the state-of-the-art parameterization in \acrshort{era5}. However, this study has successfully built a end-to-end trainable \acrshort{convlstm}-model on \acrshort{ecc} and applied it to the cloud forecasting problem. Verifying the proof of concept that data driven learning on simple meteorological variables can be used to perform climate predictions.

%This study verified the proof of concept, data driven learning can be applied to forecast cloud cover.
%This study has successfully applied data driven learning to the cloud forecasting problem.An important and valuable contribution was made by building an end-to-end trainable Con-vLSTM-model based on ECC, training a ConvLSTM-model with a larger dataset than earlierstudies. This is a indication that there may in fact be sufficient information in simple meteorological variables to perform climate predictions.
%In conclusion, at their current state data driven learning approaches are not appropriate forimplementations toward practical applications. However, they show potential for furtherstudies and development, as this proof of concept study was verifie
%under investigation. Proving that data driven learning, using $ConvLSTM-B_{10}-SL_{24}-32-3\times3-32-3 \times3$, can be used to predict cloud cover.
%In this ``proof of concept'' study it was proven that $AR-B-L5$- and $ConvLSTM-B_{10}-SL_{24}-32-3\times3-32-3 \times3$-model was able to learn how to forecast cloud cover. 
%Unfortunately, the models have somthing more left to learn before they can compete with state-of-the-art parameterization feks. in reanalysis (ERA5). Hopefully this study can serve as motivation and a suitable starting point for similar studies.
