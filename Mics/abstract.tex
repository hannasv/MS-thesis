\textbf{Pass på at plassen et tema får i abstract og oppgaven generelt er representativut på hvor mye tid du har brukt på det...}
%Ikke skriv masteroppgaven som om LSTM kommer til å funke. Skriv generelt at i denne oppgaven skal vi test to metoder. Hugo. 

\subsection*{Introduce topic and why its important}
Over the last decades researchers have been working on determining the climate sensitivity. %The fifth assessment report result in a range of 1.5K to 4.7K. Here 4.7K allows for a doubling of the $CO_2$ emissions compared to 1.5K. 
 Clouds are important in todays climate, reflecting 50\% of the solar radiation back into space. Society need (or demand) a more accurate description of what may happens in future climates.
%Trap less heat because of global warming. 

\subsection*{Introduce a challenge or unresolved issue that you will try and solve.} Most of this uncertainty is attributed to how clouds are resolved in climate models.
%Large uncertainties associated with the effect of clouds in future climates. 
Its unclear to which level of sophistication these sub-grid scale parametrizations need to be in order model their effect on climate.

\subsection*{What have you done to try and solving this.}
To investigate this problem from a new angle  sdata driven learning potential for parameterisation of clouds, a new dataset, \acrfull{ecc}, was compiled. \textbf{skal jeg skrive based på hvilke dataset og at det krever implementering av software..?}

Statistical methods like autoregressive models was compared against \acrfull{convlstm} on their ability to parameterize cloud cover.

\subsection*{Main result - Include the numerical result of your best model.}

Main result on numerical models.

\subsection*{The implications in the context of 1+2.}
Offer a staring point for further development..? \textbf{How to include the implications of what seems to be two bad models.}
