\section{Summary of contributions and main findings }
State something great about the dataset.



\section{Future work}

In future work it would be interesting to asses how data driven parametrisation compare to the existing parametrisaions available in the state of the art climate models. Here both the temporal and spatial resolution is a lot coarser. Other data sets could be considered. The masks in other data sets are computed based on more channels than in METeosat but the temporal resolution is a lot worse.
