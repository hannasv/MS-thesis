\section{Parametrization of clouds} \label{sec:param_clouds}
%\textit{In doing so, we do not include the effects of changes to the cloud microphysics explicitly.} Building a model based on meteorological variables provided by a reliable estimate from reanalysis datasets.
All climate simulations are limited by computational power, parameterization allows us to simulate the effects of clouds on the climate. The development of both observational and modelling systems requires a understanding of the physical and biogeochemical processes that takes place in the earth system (\cite{Simmons2016Observation2016-2025}). New ideas are implemented into models and tested. The simulated climate should be in accordance with observations and be able recreate previous climate. 

The complex nature of clouds originates from lots of different processes occurring simultaneously on different scales. Incorporating all these interactions into a model framework has proven to be difficult (\cite{IPCC_CH9_climate_models} +++ ). \textbf{Finn multiple sources}

% Due to small scale of the processes involved, modelling the effects of clouds on the earth system requires parameterizations. 
% Due to the large uncertainty in \acrfull{ecs} related to clouds. 

%This area has received a lot of attention the last few years. A consequence of increasing the complexity of the models is the trailing increase in uncertainty. Popular approaches are saturation threshold, \acrfull{pdf} and \acrfull{crm}. 

%The data driven approach taken in this thesis does not net this case-specific adjustment. Doesn't need different approaches for different regimes, but relies on the satellites capabilities to detect them. Cirrus being the most difficult. When you one as seperate parameterizations for different cloud regimens, a consequence of this is that the cloud fraction might exceed 1.

\subsection{Relative humidity schemes}
The simplest form of cloud scheme is a binary. A pixel is either cloudy or clear. Equation \eqref{eq:binary_param_clouds} describes a diagnostic relationship between cloud cover and relative humidity. Binary saturation threshold can be implemented as follows,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:binary_param_clouds}
    CFC\left(RH\right) = 
     \begin{cases}
       \text{0,} &\quad\text{if RH}\le100\\
       \text{1,} &\quad\text{else}
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Statistical schemes}
Most climate models have a fractional cloud cover, which is driven by a saturation threshold. All the vapour in excess of this threshold, often $RH=100\%$, gets transformed into cloud liquid water. Sub-grid scale variability is necessary to achieve fractional cloud cover. The most common variables either alone or in combination is relative humidity, temperature and vertical velocity (\cite{Golaz2002_part1}, ++ ).\textbf{cite more papers parametrizing this - draw inspiration from table?}  

Based on observations from air plane campaigns, researches have attempted to draw statistical distributions of relevant variables. These \acrfull{pdf} are implemented into models. Virtually all existing \acrshort{pdf}s have been used to model either cloud cover or its dependant variables. % humidity, temperature and so on. 
A reproduction of the summary from \cite{Tompkins2009CloudParametrization}, describing distribution used in a selection of papers is given in Table \ref{tab:summary_PDF}.
\input{Chapter2_Theory/tables/param_summary_tomkins}
Researchers have not been successful in finding a adequate representation of cloud cover using these approaches (\cite{Tompkins2009CloudParametrization}) \textbf{Dobbelsjekk at det st√•r der}. 

\cite{Golaz2002_part1} derived a joint \acrshort{pdf} the sub-gridscale variability, serving as the base for parametrizing boundary layer clouds. This scheme is implemented in \acrfull{noresm} and \acrfull{cesm}, to recognised \acrshort{esm} (\textbf{citation ask Trude}). The parameterization can be considered a higher-order turbulent closure problem. The first (mean), second (variance) and third order statistical moments, of the vertical velocity ($w$), the liquid water potential temperature ($\theta_l$), and the total water specific humidity ($q_t$) determines the family of \acrshort{pdf}s. Its designed to be flexible enough to (avoid the use of) circumvent the case specific adjustment. For more details see \cite{Golaz2002_part1} and \cite{Golaz2002_part2}.

%What is necessary to understand why clouds are Parameterisations. Cite that all climate models are wrong but some are useful.
\subsection{Cloud resolving models} \label{sec:params_climate_models}
Another method of cloud parameterization is using \acrfull{crm}. On the contrary of what the name implies, this type of model still have problems with resolving the smallest cloud processes. 

Running a \acrfull{les}-model, the increased resolution are able to resolve convective motions, but microphysical processes and turbulence effects still require parameterizations. \citeauthor{Baba2019SpectralModel} used this approach for parameterizing a spectral cumulus cloud. Obtaining the entrainment rate based on cloud properties from a \acrshort{crm} they build a parameterization valid for both shallow and deep convection. \textit{Entrainment rate} is the rate at which surrounding air penetrate the cloud. Preserving the physical properties, its important that the method handles co-existing phenomena (\cite{Baba2019SpectralModel}). 

%Accelerating the speed of computations is always useful. 
\acrshort{dl} provide suitable methods for emulating, aimed to accelerate the speed of the heavy computations in \acrshort{crm}. Emulation in the context of computing referrers to, imitation of one model using another one. In this example the statistical models are used to mimic the behavior of the physically based \acrshort{crm}. The \acrshort{dl} model performance is restricted by the  \acrshort{crm}, performing at best as good as the \acrshort{crm} (\cite{Rasp2018DeepModels}).
