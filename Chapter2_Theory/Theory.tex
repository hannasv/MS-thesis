\chapter{Theoretical Background } \label{ch:theoretical_back}
This chapter describes the background for this thesis work. It is organised as follows. The three first sections, describes clouds role in the climate system both present and future. Starting with cloud formation and dissipation, including the clouds effect on radiative budget in the current climate and the suggestion of future cloud climatologies as proposed by \acrfull{ipcc} in assessment report 5. Followed by a brief introduction to parametrization of clouds, the method used to incorporate clouds into models.
% Therefore necessary in studies of cloud feedback's. %in future climates. 
Finally, the data used to compile the dataset is introduced.

%The contributions of the clouds to the short wave component in the radiative budget is the main contributor to the uncertainty. Short wave cloud feedback. \textit{To this day neither observations of \acrfull{gcm} provide clear evidence or contradict the low level clouds feedback}. There is no accepted basis to refuse a \acrshort{gcm} \textit{a priori} \textbf{this increases the multi-model mean spread in climate sensitivity}. Missing representations of clouds micro-physical processes related to opacity or cirrus (high altitude, composed of ice) clouds. \textbf{cite AR5}

%The computational cost of generating these large ensembles are limiting factor. Simplified models in terms of resolution and/ or complexity is common/often necessary. 

%The proposed parameterization of clouds includes some considerable simplifications, neglecting cloud microphisics.

\section{Data}
\textbf{Present the data section..?}
Satellite derived cloud cover. Moisture originated from the surface.

\subsection{ERA5} \label{sec:era5}
ERA5 is the latest in the series of reanalysis produced by \acrfull{ecmwf}. Re-analysis is as close to observations as one can get coherent in space and time. It is produced using a forecast model to assimilate observations. Data assimilation take observations and input and tries to make a accurate estimate of the state of the system. This includes observations from ground based, ships, bouyes, airplanes and satellites. The analysis is produced in the operational system, making it available within five days of real time. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System, IFS cycle 4lr2. The data is available in $0.25^o$ degree and hourly resolution. Its an important product for the continuous climate monitoring of the earth system. (\cite{Hersbach2018OperationalStatus}).

Reanalyses data is often mistakenly referred to as observations. \citeauthor{Parker2016ReanalysesDifference} published a essay in \acrfull{bams} on this topic in \citeyear{Parker2016ReanalysesDifference} (\cite{Parker2016ReanalysesDifference}). Based on the following three points they conclude that observations and re-analysis are not to different. First, both involve inference (theory based calculations). Second. re-analysis relies on forecast and observations does not. This is not a significant difference as long as the forecast is sufficiently accurate. Third, its important to be aware of that the uncertainty of the reanalysis is less well known than for observations. This makes it harder to judge appropriate use of the reanalysis. 

\subsection{Remote sensing of cloud properties}
Satellites are instruments capable of providing continuous global measurements. Two types of sensors, passive and active imagers. The passive imaging sensor detects natural occurring levels of radiation. While the active sensor,  detect the radiation returned from a emitted artificially fixed pulse of radiation.
\input{Chapter2_Theory/subplot_satellite_channels}

\citeauthor{Karlsson2015AdvancingData} list the five key properties for remote sensing of clouds using passive imagery. Figure \ref{fig:SEVIRI_channels} shows examples on signals detected by \acrshort{msg} at different wavelengths. This includes the four spectral bands, WV 6.2, VIS 0.6, IR 3.9 and IR 10.8. Lower radiance's are displayed in darker colours and higher is white. In general anything that appears bright have a higher reflectance at the \acrfull{toa} than the surface. 

Clouds appear bright in VIS and NIR channels, see Figure \ref{fig:VIS_0.6}. Clouds consisting of liquid droplets reflect strongly in SWIR and MWIR. This is shown in Figure \ref{fig:IR_3.9}. The earth surface, including snow and ice, appear dark. This allows for detection of low level clouds at night. Exploiting the fact that clouds are not perfectly emitting black bodies. Cloud are typically colder than the earth surface. Cirrus cloud are optically thin, but can be detected using split window channels (IR10.8 and IR12.0) differences (see Figure \ref{fig:IR_10.8}). Figure \ref{fig:WV_6.2} shows detected water vapour. In general broken clouds give rise to scattered pattern or texture in images otherwise homogeneous, ice-free ocean for instance. To summaries the success of a screening is dependant on the illumination, the state of the surface and atmosphere (\cite{Karlsson2015AdvancingData}).  

The number of spectral bands and footprint size (pixel resolution) determine the practical application a particular retrieval can be used for. Differences in swath width determine the frequency at a given position. Viewing angle affect the optical properties of the medium (but also its apparent position). \textit{Parallax} describes the apparent shift in position of a object, when you move the observer along a axis. This is a issue in remote sensing. Positions of satellites are moved. High viewing angles may cause similar issues. Since the position of objects is relevant to the viewing angle, in particular with high clouds. This factor is negligible when detecting low clouds (\cite{Joro2010ComparisonFinland}). Moving the observer (satellite) changes the apparent position of the measurement. 

Differences in sensitivity and retrieval algorithms contribute to a large spread in global mean cloud amount among different cloud products. In their assessment of global cloud datasets \citeauthor{Stubenrauch2013AssessmentPanel} compared the global mean cloud cover of six datasets (ISCCP, PATMOS-x, MODIS-ST, MODIS-CE, AIR-LMD and TOVS Path-B). In this process they eliminating MISR and ATSR-GRAPE because of different observation times (see Table 3 in \cite{Stubenrauch2013AssessmentPanel} ) and two outlier datasets, HIRS-NOAA and POLDER. Their results show that the difference among the six datasets, the difference is of order 0.08. On the contrary, local differences could be up to 0.4 (\cite{Stubenrauch2013AssessmentPanel}). 

%Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations, CALISO is much used in other research because it gives a vertically resolved cloud (3D observations). This additional spatial information is provided on the expense of frequency and uncertainty. \textit{Reason why calipso is ruled out as a candidate. large uncertainty Stubenau} MODIS has low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution, one to two days. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA \textbf{ something}. Most polar orbiting satellites have a resolution at best daily. \textbf{kilde (shubenau)} \textbf{Does the other one give ferdig produkter av skyfraksjoner og eller er mye lettere og regridde??} The number of channels (higher for other than METEOSAT). The more channels you have the more accurate cloud detection algorihms you can use. Most of the uncertainty in satellite retrivals are attributed to the presence of clouds.

\subsection{METeosat Second Generation, MSG} \label{sec:meteosat}
Prior to the launch of the METeosat researchers discussed the temporal frequency suitable for the observing weather. The METeosat first generation had a temporal resolution of 30min \textbf{kilde}. For the second generation, 15min intervals was chosen to best cope with the short lifetime and rapid deformation of clouds. It was also suggested that a temporal frequency of 1 to 10min is necessary tracking cumulus type clouds. \textbf{kilde stubenau - må være en annen kilde}. This agrees with the Table 1.3 (see \cite{lohmann2016}, pp. 19) stating the lifetimes of different type clouds. 

A \textit{ring} of geostationary satellites located at equator providing a global covering (excluding polar regions). The altitude of satellite determine the forward velocity and is chosen for the geostationary orbit. To achieve this orbit it needs to maintain a height of $\sim 36 000km $. 

The first Meteosat Second Generation (MSG-1) was lauched 28 August 2002. It became operational 29 January 2004 and got renamed Meteosat-8. The \acrshort{msg} system provides a two satellite system, one operational and one standby. This introduces some complications related to the parallax. This becomes evident in comparison of  simultaneous measurements for the operation and the standby METeosat satellites. \ref{tab:dataset_summary} The operational satellite at a nadir point of $0^o$ latitude. Samples a full disk in cycles of 15min. A full disk is $3712\times 3712$ pixels.

The \acrfull{msg} was established as a corporation between \acrfull{esa} and \acrfull{eumetsat}. \acrshort{esa} was in charge of developing the prototype of MSG-1. \acrshort{eumetsat} is responsible for maintaining the user requirements, launch procedures, developing ground segments, ensuring over all system consistency and day to day operations.  \acrshort{msg} primary function is to provide a continuous observations of the earths full disk. Near-constant sampling frequency and a geostationary orbit allows for observing weather phenomena occurring on short scales. Since the satellite always is located at $0^o$ the spatial resolution is not constant spatial resolution, unlike the polar orbiting satellites. The resolution becomes coarser with increasing off-nadir viewing angle (\cite{Stubenrauch2013AssessmentPanel}). There are efforts invested in extending the MSG dataset with the MFG, in order to make use of the time series all the way back to 1980. \textbf{kilde, launched 1977} This is requires new cloud detection algorithms since they only have three common channels and two of them are useful for detecting clouds. \textbf{kilde Stöckli} This could potentially be useful in the future. 

On board the \acrshort{msg} is the \acrfull{seviri} imaging radiometer. Its has  12 spectral channels. The scan is done south to north, east to west. The wavelength of the discrete channels are chosen based on heritage from other sensors. One broadband visible channel, three solar channels (0.6, 0.8 and 1.6 $\mu m$) and 8 thermal infrared channels (3.9, 6.2, 7.3, 8.7, 9.7, 10.8, 12.0 and 13.4 $\mu m$) (\cite{Taravat2015MultilayerMasking}). (Taravat, 2015)  This is of great advantage since much of the community already know how to use the \acrshort{seviri} radiance observations. The channels have been chosen based on their ability to detect clouds, water vapour and ozone. More information about what the different channels detect is available in this paper \textit{An introduction to METeosat second generation (MSG)} published in \acrshort{bams} 2002 (\cite{Schmetz_meteosat_intro}).

%You may calculate the difference of the measurements, e.g. for channels VIS0.6, IR3.9 and IR10.8 between the two satellites. This will give an estimate how large the measurements differ and as a consequence the products (e.g. cloud mask) will be different.\textbf{also personal correspondance.}
The operational cloud detection algorithm is pixel by pixel. Post processing involves re-classifying isolated pixels. There is a lot of effort invested in new detection algorithms including spatial structures. One of the methods that show potential here is deep learning \textbf{List many sources.}

%The viewing angle attributes to small differences in detected cloud mask. Explained by parallax. This becomes evident when the standby and operational satellite scan simultaneously. By default the standby satellite is adjusted to fit the position of the operational. By taking the difference some small patterns becomes visible. This is not accounted/adjusted for when using the data. Sometimes both satellites gather data at the same time. Then the standby-satellite grid is rectified to a a grid of the operational one \textbf{(Personal correspondence EUMETSAT staff).} 

\subsection{EUMETSAT Cloud Mask} \label{sec:EUMETSAT_cloud_mask}

The \acrshort{eumetsat} cloud mask, CLM consist of four classes, described in table \ref{tab:classes_clm}.

\input{Chapter2_Theory/tables/description_EUMETSAT_cloud_mask}
\input{Chapter2_Theory/tables/msg_spectral_bands}

These classes are derived from almost all channels except HRV and isolated pixels are reclassified \textbf{cite article 10 in Tavarat, 2015}. The cloud mask is distributed in GRIdded Binary or General Regularly-distributed Information in Binary form (GRIB) (no coordinates) and network Common Data Form (NetCDF) (coordinates). The data is available on Earth Observation Portal on EUMETSATS web pages.

\subsubsection{summary}
This thesis aim to devolop and/or explore methods of parameterising cloud cover based on macro-scale variables like humidity, surface temperature and pressure. Regressing historical observations against macro physical properties which affect clouds. Moving away from the subgrid scale processes. Wish to answar weather there be enough information in humidity, temperature and surface pressure to predict clouds in a time and space.
