Human activity changes the envionments, while the globe need to support the lives of a increasing population. Providing a realistic estimate of future climates is important for motivating mitigation and hopefulle reducing the mean temperature increase. Earth system models, ESM are usefull tool for studing the past and future climate. Observations are used to aid the development of models. It is common to validate a model against observation to ensure that it is capable of describiong the desired mechanisms.

\section{Parametrisation of clouds} \label{sec:param_clouds}
Det finnes mange klimamodeller eller numeriske værvarslingsmodeller. Disse er av forskjellig grad av komplexitet. Detter refererer til hvor mange mekasnismer som er med på å påvirke skydannelsen. Bare AR5 inneholder X antall klimamodeller. This section will  give a brief introduction to some methods used for parameterizing clouds. This is just the tip of the iceberg, the aim is to give \textbf{what}. Including all the small scale processes described in the previous sections is
an impossible task. Limited by computational resources and knowledge of interactions in cloud. 

Including the effect from clouds on the earth system first need a reliable estimate of whether there is a cloud in no cloud in a pixel. Secondly, progressing toward knowing how much cloud there is. Lets distinguish between micro- and macrophysical properties of cloud. Microphysical processes are all mechanisms involving the particles making up a cloud. Examples of these variable are cloud condensation nuclei and droplet number concentrations. Macrophysics properties are for the entire cloud. Concerned with its base height, top height, thickness, fractional cover and cloud type.

Even thought precipitation formation and cloud optical thickness is affected by changes on a macrophysical level. They are undeniably closely related to the macrophysical properties of the cloud. Imagine precipitation without a cloud fractional cover. Due to small scale modelling the effects of clouds on the earth system requires parameterizations.  Clouds vary on a smaller scale than what the average earth system models are able to resolve. 

Various approaches have been used the last couple of years. Due to the large uncertinty in equilibrium climate sensitivity related to clouds. This area has recieved a lot of attension the last few years. Causing a increase in inter-model spread in climate sensitivity. Beause of more complex increased complexity of parameterisations. Used approaches are saturation threshold, probability density functions, PDF's, joint probability functions and cloud resolving models. It is worth noting that cloud resolving models have a increased resolution and thus resolve more mechanisms involved in cloud formation. However, the name is misleading since it still requires parameterizations of smallest scale processes.

Cloud-aerosol effects in climate models created many parameterizations dependant on each other.
Many parameterizations are again dependant on others. Nested dependancies of parameterizations. Scheme is a set of parameterizations.One variables distribution being the result of many interacting processes.

% er en joint probability density function always dependant on multiple variables.
\textbf{Move to somewhere else: Neglecting the microphysical properties we wish to parameterize cloud fractional cover.
The data driven approach taken in this thesis does not net this case-specific adjustment. Doesn't need different approaches for different regimes, but relies on the satellites capabilities to detect them. Cirrus being the most difficult. }

\subsection{Relative humidity schemes}
The simplest form of cloud scheme is a \textit{all-of-nothing} scheme. This is binary. Either the entire pixel is covered by clouds or there is no clouds. See Equation \ref{eq:binary_param_clouds}. Describing a diagnostic relationship between cloud cover and relative humidity. Binary saturation threshold can be implemented as follows,
\begin{equation} \label{eq:binary_param_clouds}
    CLA\left(RH\right) = 
     \begin{cases}
       \text{0,} &\quad\text{if RH}\le100\\
       \text{1,} &\quad\text{else}
     \end{cases}
\end{equation}
Sub-grid scale variability is necessary to achieve fractional cloud cover. This can ba a combination of multiple variables. The most common being relative humidity, temperature and/or vertical velocity. 

\textbf{more}

\subsection{Statistical schemes}
Based on observations (from airplane campains) researches have attempted to draw dirstibutions of relevant variables. Reaserchers have then implemented these PDF's into models. Virtually all probability density functions, PDF's have been used to model either cloud cover or its dependant variables humidity, temperature and so on. See table \ref{tab:summary_PDF} for a summary of the PDF's used in different papers. They have not been successful in finding a adequate representation of cloud cover using this approach. \textbf{(siter Tomkins summary)}. The most sucessful is being joint PDF's. One examples of a usecase of these functions are used in NorESM and CESM to parameterize boundary layer clouds. \textbf{(Source Trude)} \textbf{Golaz et al 2002}. They use a joint probability density function of 

Their parameterization can be regarded as a higher order turbulent closure problem. Big advantage of this sceme is that the same scheme can be applied to all regimes. It is quite difficult to devolop a general condition desciding which regime it is.  
For more details see Golaz et. al. 2002.

\textit{Their integration into numerical models continous to be pose a challange.}
\textit{Categorizing into regimes leads to the difficult problems of interfacing various components to obtain general purpose parameterizations.}


\textbf{Om noe er litt tilfeldig, however is somewhat arbitrary.}

Cloud cover is usually a combination of several parametrisations. Its common to have separate schemes for ice-, liquid clouds and convective clouds. \textbf{Read more Tomkins}

%What is necessary to understand why clouds are Parameterisations. Cite that all climate models are wrong but some are useful.
\subsection{Parametrisations of clouds - Climate models} \label{sec:params_climate_models}
\textit{Trude: Most climate models have a fractional cloud cover, which is driven by saturation threshold. All the vapour in excess of saturation, $RH=100\%$, gets turned into cloud water. Producing a cloud. Some models include aerosol-cloud interactions.  

In global climate models all michcrophysics (bilde lohman), convection are parametrised in dependant structures. Climate models output monthly mean/or et tidspunkt hver måned.}
\textbf{Include details on parameterisations in climate models}

One method to deal with this is cloud parameterisation are cloud resolving models. This runs a LES-model. You still need to parametrise the michrophysical scheme, but the model might be able to resolve the convection. \textbf{Read paper.} DEEP LEARNING IS USED TO EMULATE THE les modells. But then again these DL models are restricted to the performance of the cloud resl

Cloud resolving models, CRM are a misleadning name. These can include some more effect like X, but still need to use parametrizations for turbulent and aerosols effects.

Some models include aerosols-clouds interaction. Modelling the cloud cover as 
function of available particles to condense upon. 

this becomes a nested set of parameterization. The clouds scheme are a function the aersols scheme and thing ultiple other phenomenas. This generates a tangled web of parameterizations.

Param aerosols involves sources and sinks. Precipitation is the main cause of deopsition of aerosols. Les om nedbør i simmons, 2016. 

% Climate models are an important tool for studying the effects of emissions/forcing on future climates. The \acrfull{ipcc} provide assessments report every ~10th year or so, providing a state of the art status update on the current knowledge of climate change. Since the previous assessment report there has been three special report A, B and C. \textbf{Les special report.} The previous report published was Assesment report 5, AR5 in 2013 and the next report is scheduled to be published in 2021. 
%The ensamble of climate models included in AR5 is \acrfull{cmip5}. \acrshort{cmip6} are now being evaluated, thus there is less published literature. Even though its a bit old, we will mostly focus on the results in AR5. \textbf{Plus the findings in the special reports.}

In resent years a lot of effort have been invested in improving the parametrisations of sub-grid scale processes. Among these clouds contribute with the largest uncertainty, approximately three times as large as other process i.e. relative humidity-lapse rate feedback (these processes should not be viewed in isolation). The contributions of the clouds to the short wave component in the radiative budget is the main contributor to the uncertainty. Short wave cloud feedback. \textit{To this day neither observations of \acrfull{gcm} provide clear evidence or contradict the low level clouds feedback}. There is no accepted basis to refuse a \acrshort{gcm} \textit{a priori} \textbf{this increases the multi-model mean spread in climate sensitivity}. Missing representations of clouds micro-physical processes related to opacity or cirrus (high altitude, composed of ice) clouds. \textbf{cite AR5}

The computational cost of generating these large ensembles are limiting factor. Simplified models in terms of resolution and/ or complexity is common/often necessary. 

Using idealised experiments they give model spread in \acrfull{ecs}. This describes the \textit{equilibrium change in global and annual mean surface temperature after doubling the $CO_2$ conditions from pre-industrial times.} For \acrshort{cmip5} the \acrshort{ecs} is $2.1^oC$ to $4.7^oC$. The is very high confidence that clouds are the primary factor attributing to the wide range. This is not a very big improvement from Hansen et. al. 1984 first estimate of climate sensitivity which was the range $2.0^oC$ to $5.0^oC$. \textbf{explain idealised experiments.} Hansen et. al. ran their experiments using a coarse resolution of $8^o \times 10^o$ grid box (lat $\times$ lon) and a doubling of the $CO_2$ concentrations from 315ppm to 630ppm. 

The proposed parameterization of clouds includes some considerable simplifications, neglecting cloud microphisics. 


\subsection{ERA5 - make sure this should be included before you write it} \label{sec:param_ERA5}
ERA5 is produced used IFS cycle 4lr2. This has a new cloud scheme or hydrological cycle. \textbf{Artikkelen forteller om oppdateringer fra sist era-interim produksjon ikke alt som finnes. Bedre å skrive denne etter du har skrevet i datasettet hvor }. Husk Tomkins jobber for ECMWF.

\section{Data}
\textbf{write introductions}


\subsection{ERA5} \label{sec:era5}
ERA5 is the latest in the series of reanalysis produced by \acrfull{ecmwf}. Re-analysis is as close to observations as one can get coherent in space and time. It is produced using a forecast model to assimilate observations. Data assimilation take observations and input and tries to make a accurate estimate of the state of the system. This includes observations from ground based, ships, bouyes, airplanes and satellites. The analysis is produced in the operational system, making it available within five days of real time. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System, IFS cycle 4lr2. The data is available in $0.25^o$ degree and hourly resolution. Its an important product for the continuous climate monitoring of the earth system. 

Reanalyses data is often mistakenly referred to as observations. This was the theme of a essay in \acrfull{bams}, 2015. Based on the following three points they conclude that observations and re-analysis are not to different. First, both involve inference (theory based calculations). Re-analysis relies on forecast and observations does not. Second, it is not a significant difference as long as the forecast is sufficiently accurate. Third, its important to be aware of that the uncertainty of the reanalysis is less well known than for observations. This makes it harder to judge appropriate use of the reanalysis. 

\textbf{In what section does the following belong.}
It can be worth noting that the all sky radiance's from \acrfull{msg} in the period 2003-2012 is included in the assimilation. This is the same satellite that provides the cloud mask. 
\textbf{One sentence explaining that we have judged the appropriate use and have come to the conclusion that using the assimilated variables and not parameterised are appropriate for this application.}

\subsection{Remote sensing of cloud properties}
Satellites are instruments capable of providing continuous global measurements. Two types of sensors, passive and active imagers. The passive imaging sensor detects natural occurring levels of radiation. Opposed to active sensor, which detect the radiation returned from a emitted artificially fixed pulse of radiation.
\input{Chapter2_Theory/subplot_satellite_channels}
Karlsson et. al. 2015 list the five key properties for remote sensing of clouds using passive imagery. To have a reference figure \ref{fig:SEVIRI_channels} shows examples on how different properties are seen by the satellite. This includes the four spectral bands, WV 6.2, VIS 0.6, IR 3.9 and IR 10.8. In general anything that appears bright have a higher reflectance at the \acrfull{toa} than the surface. Lower radiences are displayed in darker colours and brighter is white. Clouds appear bright in VIS and NIR channels, see \ref{fig:VIS_0.6}. Clouds consisting of liquid droplets reflect strongly in SWIR and MWIR. This is shown in figure \ref{fig:IR_3.9}. The earth surface, including snow and ice, appear dark. This allows for detection of low level clouds at night. Exploiting the fact that clouds are not perfectly emitting black bodies. Cloud are typically colder than the earth surface. Cirrus cloud are optically thin, but can be detected using split window channels (IR10.8 and IR12.0) differences. See figure \ref{fig:IR_10.8}. Figure \ref{fig:WV_6.2} shows detected water vapour. In general broken clouds give rise to scattered pattern or texture in images otherwise homogeneous, ice-free ocean for instance. To summaries the success of a screening is dependant on the illumination, the state of the surface and atmosphere. \textbf{kalsson et al} The number of spectral bands and footprint size (pixel resolution) determine the practical application a particular retrieval can be used for. Differences in swath width determine the frequency at a given position. Viewing angle affect the optical properties of the medium (but also its apparent position). \textit{Parallax} describes the apparent shift in position of a object, when you move the observer along a axis. This is a issue in remote sensing. Positions of satellites are moved and high viewing angles may cause similar issues. Since the position of objects is relevant to the viewing angle. A high viewing angle may introduce problems with parallax of high clouds. This factor is negligible when detecting low clouds (Joro et al). Moving the observer (satellite) changes the apparent position of the measurement. Th

Differences in sensitivity and retrieval algorithms contribute to a large spread in global mean cloud amount among different cloud products. In their assessment of global cloud datasets Studbenau et. al. 2013 compared the global mean cloud cover of six datasets (ISCCP, PATMOS-x, MODIS-ST, MODIS-CE, AIR-LMD and TOVS Path-B). In this process they eliminating MISR and ATSR-GRAPE because of different observation times \textbf{(ref the table in the article)} and two outlier datasets, HIRS-NOAA and POLDER. Their results show that the difference among the six datasets, the difference is of order 0.08. On the contrary, local differences could be up to 0.4. Its worth noting that the satellite data using in this thesis is not included in Schubanaus study, but its illustrates nicely the large differences among other datasets. 

%Cloud-Aerosol Lidar and Infrared Pathfinder Satellite Observations, CALISO is much used in other research because it gives a vertically resolved cloud (3D observations). This additional spatial information is provided on the expense of frequency and uncertainty. \textit{Reason why calipso is ruled out as a candidate. large uncertainty Stubenau} MODIS has low spatial resolution but high temporal resolution, one to two days. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA \textbf{ something}. Most polar orbiting satellites have a resolution at best daily. \textbf{kilde (shubenau)} \textbf{Does the other one give ferdig produkter av skyfraksjoner og eller er mye lettere og regridde??} The number of channels (higher for other than METEOSAT). The more channels you have the more accurate cloud detection algorihms you can use. Most of the uncertainty in satellite retrivals are attributed to the presence of clouds.  

\textbf{Hugo how much where you thinking of including from other satellites.}

\subsection{METeosat Second Generation, MSG} \label{sec:meteosat}
Prior to the launch of the METeosat researchers discussed the temporal frequency suitable for the observing weather. The METeosat first generation had a temporal resolution of 30min \textbf{kilde}. For the second generation, 15min intervals was chosen to best cope with the short lifetime and rapid deformation of clouds. It was also suggested that a temporal frequency of 1 to 10min is necessary tracking cumulus type clouds. \textbf{kilde stubenau - må være en annen kilde}. This agrees with the table 1.3 in Lohmann et. al. stating the lifetimes of different type clouds. \textbf{kilde Lohmann s. 19} There is a \textit{ring} of geostationary satellites located at equator providing a global covering (not included polar regions). The altitude of satellite determine the forward velocity and is chosen for the geostationary orbit. To achieve this orbit it needs to maintain a height of $\sim 36 000km $. The first Meteosat Second Generation (MSG-1) was lauched 28 August 2002. It became operational 29 January 2004 and got renamed Meteosat-8. The \acrshort{msg} system provides a two satellite system, one operational and one standby. This introduces issues related to the parallax. It becomes evident when comparing simultaneous measurements for the operation and the standby METeosat satellites. \ref{tab:dataset_summary} The operational satellite at a nadir point of $0^o$ latitude. Samples a full disk in cycles of 15min. A full disk is $3712\times 3712$ pixels.
%\textbf{Thoughts:}
%\begin{enumerate}
%    \item Would it be possible to see further north if the altitude where higher? (Wouldn't be geostationary anymore but would you.)
%    \item Må den alltid være på latitude = 0 for å være geostationary? 
%\end{enumerate}
%METeosat is the only geostationary satellite covering the Europe, Africa and India?. Geostationary \textit{ring} of GEO-satellites. 
The \acrfull{msg} was established as a corporation between \acrfull{esa} and \acrfull{eumetsat}. \acrshort{esa} was in charge of developing the prototype of MSG-1. \acrshort{eumetsat} is responsible for maintaining the user requirements, launch procedures, developing ground segments, ensuring over all system consistency and day to day operations.  \acrshort{msg} primary function is to provide a continuous observations of the earths full disk. Near-constant sampling frequency and a geostationary orbit allows for observing weather phenomena occurring on short scales. Since the satellite always is located at $0^o$ the spatial resolution is not constant spatial resolution, unlike the polar orbiting satellites. The resolution becomes coarser with increasing off-nadir viewing angle. \textbf{kilde stubenau} There are efforts invested in extending the MSG dataset with the MFG, in order to make use of the timeseries all the way back to 1980. \textbf{kilde, launched 1977} This is requires new cloud detection algorithms since they only have three common channels and two of them are useful for detecting clouds. \textbf{kilde Stöckli} This could potentially be useful in the future. 

On board the \acrshort{msg} is the \acrfull{seviri} imaging radiometer. Its has  12 spectral channels. The scan is done south to north, east to west. The wavelength of the discrete channels are chosen based on heritage from other sensors. One broadband visible channel, three solar channels (0.6, 0.8 and 1.6 $\mu m$) and 8 thermal infrared channels (3.9, 6.2, 7.3, 8.7, 9.7, 10.8, 12.0 and 13.4 $\mu m$). (Taravat, 2015)  This is of great advantage since much of the community already know how to use the \acrshort{seviri} radiance observations. The channels have been chosen based on their ability to detect clouds, water vapour and ozone. More information about what the different channels detect is available in this paper \textit{An introduction to METeosat second generation (MSG)} published in BAMS 2002 \textbf{kilde Schmetz}. % \ref{tab:dataset_summary}.

%You may calculate the difference of the measurements, e.g. for channels VIS0.6, IR3.9 and IR10.8 between the two satellites. This will give an estimate how large the measurements differ and as a consequence the products (e.g. cloud mask) will be different.\textbf{also personal correspondance.}
The operational cloud detection algorithm is pixel by pixel. Post processing involves re-classifing isolated pixels. There is a lot of effort invested in new detection algorithms including spatial structures. One of the methods that show potential here is deep learning \textbf{List many sources.}

The viewing angle attributes to small differences in detected cloud mask. Explained by parallax. This becomes evident when the standby and operational satellite scan simultaneously. By default the standby satellite is adjusted to fit the position of the operational. By taking the difference some small patterns becomes visible. This is not accounted/adjusted for when using the data. Sometimes both satellites gather data at the same time. Then the standby-satellite grid is rectified to a a grid of the operational one \textbf{(Personal correspondence EUMETSAT staff).} 

\subsection{EUMETSAT Cloud Mask} \label{sec:EUMETSAT_cloud_mask}
