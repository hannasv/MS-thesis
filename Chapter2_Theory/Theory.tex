\chapter{Theoretical Background/ Climate and Cloud Physcis} \label{ch:theoretical_back}
This chapter describes the necessary theoretical background on clouds for this study. It is organised as follows. The three first sections describe the cloud's role in both present and future climate systems. Beginning with cloud formation and dissipation, including the cloud effects on Earth's radiative budget in the current climate and the suggestion of future cloud climatologies as proposed by \acrshort{ipcc} in \acrshort{ar5}. This is followed by a brief introduction to parameterization of clouds, i.e. the method used to incorporate clouds into climate models.
% Therefore necessary in studies of cloud feedback's. %in future climates. 
Finally, the data used in the compilation of the \acrshort{ecc} dataset is introduced.

\section{Data}
This section presents the data used in the compilation of the dataset, including background information about remote sensing of cloud properties and the method used to retrieve the data. 

\subsection{ERA5} \label{sec:era5}
ERA5 is the latest in the series of reanalyses produced by \acrfull{ecmwf}. Reanalysis is as close to observations as one can get while still obtaining data that is complete and coherent in both space and time. It is produced using a forecast model to assimilate observations. Data assimilation take observations as input and tries to make an accurate estimate of the state of the system that is as consistent as possible with the available observations at all times. This includes observations retrieved from satellites, ships, buoys, airplanes and ground-based stations. The analysis is produced in the operational forecast system, making it available within five days of real time. ERA5 is based on the Integrated Forecasting System, IFS cycle 4lr2. The data is available at a horizontal resolution of $0.25^o$ degree and hourly temporal resolution. It is an important product for the continuous monitoring of the Earth system 
(\cite{Hersbach2018OperationalStatus}).

Reanalyses data is often mistakenly referred to as observations. \citeauthor{Parker2016ReanalysesDifference} published an essay in \acrfull{bams} on this topic in \citeyear{Parker2016ReanalysesDifference}. Based on the following three points they conclude that observations and reanalyses are not too different. First, both involve inference, in other words, theory-based calculations. Second, reanalysis relies on forecast and observations do not. This is not a significant difference as long as the forecast is sufficiently accurate. Third, it is important to be aware that the uncertainty of the reanalyses is less well known than for observations. This makes it harder to judge the appropriate use of the reanalyses (\cite{Parker2016ReanalysesDifference}). 

\subsection{Remote sensing of cloud properties}
Satellites are the only instruments capable of providing continuous global measurements.
Measurements are collected by sensors, of which two types exist; passive and active imagers. The passive imaging sensors detect natural occurring levels of radiation, e.g. thermal radiation emitted by mediums. In contrast, active sensors  detect radiation returned from an emitted artificially fixed pulse of radiation (\cite{Stephens2018CloudsatSystem}). From \cite{Stockli2019CloudApplications}, \textit{the separation of the cloud from the cloud-free (reference signal) has been an everlasting problem in satellite-based cloud detection}.
\input{Chapter2_Theory/subplot_satellite_channels}

\citepaper{Karlsson2015AdvancingData} list the five key properties exploited in remote sensing of clouds using passive imagery, these will be explained drawing examples from Figure \ref{fig:SEVIRI_channels}. High radiances are displayed in white and lower in darker colours. In general anything that appears bright has a higher reflection at the \acrshort{toa} than the surface. 

(1) Clouds appear bright as opposed to ice free water surfaces and vegetated Earth's surface in \acrshort{vis} and \acrshort{nir}. The detection from VIS 0.6 is shown in Figure \ref{fig:VIS_0.6}.

(2) Clouds consisting of liquid droplets reflect strongly in \acrfull{swir} and \acrfull{mwir}. The signal from MIR 3.9 is displayed in Figure \ref{fig:MIR_3.9}. Here the Earth's surface, including snow and ice, appear dark. Clouds are not perfectly emmiting black bodies and this allows for detection of low level clouds at night.

(3) Clouds are typically colder than the Earth's surface. Therefore they appear bright in IR channels, when displayed in reverse i.e. with low radiences shown as bright.

(4) Cirrus cloud are optically thin, but can be detected using split window channels (\acrshort{ir}10.8 and \acrshort{ir}12.0) differences (see Figure \ref{fig:IR_10.8}). 

(5) The last property not shown in this figure is the fact that broken clouds typically give rise to scattered patterns or texture in images with otherwise homogeneous, ice-free ocean for instance. 

Figure \ref{fig:WV_6.2} also show the signal detected from WV 6.2, water  vapour have a absorbtion band at these wavelength useull for detected water vapour. 

To summarise, the success of a screening is dependent on the illumination, the state of the surface and atmosphere. And it has proven most difficult over bright surfaces like snow and dessert (\cite{Karlsson2015AdvancingData}). 

Improved technologies allow for measuring new variables, one example of such advances is the use of active sensors. Active sensors provide a more refined image of vertical profiles and allows for the detection of cloud phase. Despite the limitations of passive sensors they provide useful historical information and in some cases higher spatial and temporal resolutions. One attempt to relate passive measurements with active measurement under the same meteorological conditions is the \textit{Afternoon constellation, A-Train} launched as a cooperation between several space agencies; \acrfull{nasa}, \acrlong{jaxa} and the french \acrfull{cnes}. This has provided a useful link between the different types of measurements (\cite{Stephens2018CloudsatSystem}). 

The number of spectral bands and footprint size (pixel resolution) determine the practical application of a particular satellite retrieval. Differences in swath width determine the frequency at a given position, determining the temporal resolution. The viewing angle affects the optical properties of the medium, and also its apparent position. \textit{Parallax} describes the apparent shift in position of a object, caused by moving the observer along an axis. This is a known issue in remote sensing. Positions of satellites are changed. Moving the observer (satellite) changes the apparent position of the measurement. 
High viewing angles may cause similar issues, in detection of high clouds. This factor is negligible when detecting low clouds (\cite{Joro2010ComparisonFinland}). 

Differences in sensitivity and retrieval algorithms contribute to a large spread in global mean cloud amount among different cloud products. This also explains the difficulties involved in using one cloud dataset to evaluate another one. In their assessment of global cloud datasets \citepaper{Stubenrauch2013AssessmentPanel} compared the global mean cloud cover of six datasets (ISCCP, PATMOS-x, MODIS-ST, MODIS-CE, AIR-LMD and TOVS Path-B). In this process they eliminating MISR and ATSR-GRAPE because of different observation times (see Table 3 in \citepaper{Stubenrauch2013AssessmentPanel} ) and two outlier datasets, HIRS-NOAA and POLDER. Their results show that the difference among the six datasets is of order 0.08. In contrast, local differences could be up to 0.4 (\cite{Stubenrauch2013AssessmentPanel}).

The more channels you have the more accurate cloud detection algorihms you can use. Most of the uncertainty in satellite retrivals are attributed to the presence of clouds.  

\subsection{METeosat Second Generation, MSG} \label{sec:meteosat}
The \acrfull{msg} was established as a corporation between \acrfull{esa} and \acrfull{eumetsat}. \acrshort{esa} was in charge of developing the prototype of MSG-1. \acrshort{eumetsat} is responsible for maintaining the user requirements, launch procedures, developing ground segments, ensuring overall system consistency and day to day operations. 

The primary function of \acrshort{msg} is to provide continuous observations of the Earth's full disk. Near-constant sampling frequency and a geostationary orbit allows for observing weather phenomena occurring on short timescales. Located at $0^o$ \acrshort{msg} provides a varying spatial resolution, unlike the polar orbiting satellites. The resolution gets coarser with increasing off-nadir viewing angle (\cite{Stubenrauch2013AssessmentPanel}). There are efforts invested in extending the MSG dataset with the \acrfull{mfg}, in order to make use of the time series all the way back to 1980 (\cite{Bojanowski2018PerformanceGenerations}). This requires new cloud detection algorithms since they only have three common channels and only two of them are useful for detecting clouds (\cite{Stockli2019CloudApplications}). 
\input{Chapter2_Theory/tables/msg_spectral_bands}

On board the \acrshort{msg} is the \acrfull{seviri} imaging radiometer. It has 12 spectral channels. The scan is done south to north, east to west. The wavelengths of the discrete channels are chosen based on heritage from other sensors. \arcshort{seviri} has one broadband visible channel, three solar channels (0.6, 0.8 and 1.6 $\mu m$) and 8 thermal infrared channels (3.9, 6.2, 7.3, 8.7, 9.7, 10.8, 12.0 and 13.4 $\mu m$) (\cite{Taravat2015MultilayerMasking}). Table \ref{tab:msg_spectral_bands}
 gives a summary of which properties is retrive by the different channels. 
This is of great advantage since much of the community already knows how to use the \acrshort{seviri} radiance observations. The channels have been chosen based on their ability to detect clouds, water vapour and ozone. More information about what the different channels detect is available in the paper \textit{An introduction to METeosat second generation (MSG)} published in \acrshort{bams} by \citepaper{Schmetz_meteosat_intro}.

Prior to the launch of the METeosat researchers discussed the temporal frequency suitable for observing weather phenomena. The METeosat first generation had a temporal resolution of 30min (\cite{Stockli2019CloudApplications}). For the second generation, 15min intervals were chosen to best cope with the short lifetime and rapid deformation of clouds. It was also suggested that a temporal frequency of 1 to 10min is necessary for tracking cumulus type clouds (\cite{Schmetz_meteosat_intro}). % 987 
This is in agreement with the Table 1.3 in \citeauthor{lohmann2016} (\citeyear{lohmann2016}, p. 19) stating the lifetimes of different types of clouds.

A \textit{ring} of geostationary satellites located at equator together provide global coverage (excluding polar regions). The altitude of the satellite determines its forward velocity. To achieve a geosynchronous orbit, a satellite needs to maintain a height of $\sim 36 000km$ (\cite{Bley2013ASEVIRI}). This height lead to a coarser spatial resolution than other satellite products retrived from other orbits. 

The first METeosat Second Generation (MSG-1) was launched 28 August 2002, and became operational 29 January 2004 when it was renamed METeosat-8. As a measure to reduce gaps, the \acrshort{msg} system provides a two-satellite system, one operational and one standby. The standby satellite scans when the operational satellite experiences technical failures. 
The operational satellite at nadir points at $0^o$ latitude. A full disk is $3712\times 3712$ pixels, and is sampled in cycles of 15min. This also include the on-board processing (\cite{Schmetz_meteosat_intro}).

The operational cloud detection algorithm is carried out pixel by pixel. Post processing involves re-classifying isolated pixels. There is a lot of effort invested in new detection algorithms including spatial structures. One of the methods that show potential here is deep learning (\cite{Dronner2018FastNetworks}, \cite{jeppesen_deep_cloud_masking}).

\subsection{EUMETSAT Cloud Mask} \label{sec:EUMETSAT_cloud_mask}
The \acrshort{eumetsat} cloud mask (CLM) consist of four classes, described in Table \ref{tab:classes_clm}.
\input{Chapter2_Theory/tables/description_EUMETSAT_cloud_mask}
These classes are derived from almost all channels except the broadband \acrshort{hrv} and isolated pixels are reclassified (\cite{Tavarat10_Derrien}). The cloud mask is distributed in \acrfull{grib},  without coordinates and \acrfull{netcdf}, processed with coordinates and reshaped into the standard rotation, as displayed i Figure \ref{fig:sat_view} The data is available via Earth Observation Portal on \acrshort{eumetsat}'s web pages.
