\subsection{Structure and Implementations}
The numerical methods used in this thesis are described in the next chapter \ref{ch:num_methods}. All the code is available on GitHub in the project repository named MS on \href{https://github.com/hannasv/MS}{https://github.com/hannasv/MS}. In this repository you will find everything you need to perform this experiment yourself. It contains descriptions for downloading data this includes requesting the correct licences. Experiments are run in notebooks and project environments are provided to ease the reproduction of results. The project environment called \textit{sciclouds} is ready for installation. This is a conda envionment, the yaml-file lists the python packages and the versions used for running this code. Below you find the code example for installing the project environment.

Maps are generated using python3 and the package cartopy. Illustrations are made using TIkZ, a language used for producing technical illustrations within the enviornment of LaTEX.

\textbf{Could move this to the README.md file on GitHub.}

git clone https://github.com/hannasv/MS.git
cd MS
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate sciclouds
